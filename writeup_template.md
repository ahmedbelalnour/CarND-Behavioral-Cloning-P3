# **Behavioral Cloning** 

## Writeup Template


**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model implements NVIDEA architecture and it consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 256 (model.py lines 64-88) 

The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 20), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 61). 

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 111-117). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 111).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road to help generalizing the model.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to add an archtecture similare to NVIDIA architecture with some modificatins.

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the NVIDIA architecture. I thought this model might be appropriate because it acts perfectly when training a similar types of images, as the traffic sign classification.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

Then I flattened the input and used 3 fully connected networks, and the last fully connected network has only one neuron which is responsible for deciding the driving angle of the car.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track like the regions that has no yellow guide line on the left or the right to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I added a special training data for these situations.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 60-109) consisted of a convolution neural network. 

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to recover when it is on the road edges. These images show what a recovery looks like starting from left to right:

To augment the data set, I also flipped images thinking that this would help generalizing the model. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

After the collection process, I had 29358 of data points.

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 3 as evidenced by the output accuracy of the network. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
